# Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Terraform - Version 0.12.0 or later
AWS CLI configured with necessary credentials

# Getting Started
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/S3-static-website-using-Terraform.git

# Navigate to the project directory:

Cd S3-static-website-using-Terraform

# Initialize Terraform:

Terraform init

# Apply the Terraform configuration:

Terraform apply

# Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

main.tf: Terraform configuration file defining the AWS resources.
variables.tf: Input variables for the Terraform configuration.
outputs.tf: Output variables for the Terraform configuration.
index.html: Example static web content.
error.html: Example error page.

# Configuration
Adjust the configuration in variables.tf to customize your S3 static website. Key variables include:

bucket_name: The name of your S3 bucket.
index_document: The default index document (e.g., index.html).
error_document: The error document for 404 errors (e.g., error.html).

# Deployment
Deploy your static website by following the steps in the "Getting Started" section. After applying the Terraform configuration, your S3 bucket will be ready to host your static content.

# Customization
Feel free to customize the project to fit your specific requirements. You can update the static web content in index.html and error.html or modify the Terraform configuration to include additional features.



# Overview
In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, simplicity and efficiency are key. This repository showcases the power of Terraform in orchestrating the creation of an Amazon S3 bucket to host your static website. Whether you're a developer, a small business, or an enthusiast looking to establish an online presence, this project offers a straightforward path to deploying and managing your content.

# Why Terraform?
Terraform, an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, enables you to define and provision infrastructure in a declarative configuration language. This project leverages Terraform's capabilities to abstract away the complexities of AWS setup, allowing you to focus on your website's content rather than the underlying infrastructure.

# Key Features
Scalability: Easily scale your static website as your content grows.
Cost-Effective: Leverage the pay-as-you-go model of AWS for optimal cost efficiency.
Automation: Streamline deployment and updates with Terraform's automation capabilities.

# Getting Started
To get started with deploying your own static website on Amazon S3, follow the steps outlined in the Getting Started section below. In just a few commands, you'll have a fully operational S3 bucket ready to host your web content.

# Project Structure
The simplicity of this project's structure is intentional. 
The main Terraform configuration file, main.tf, defines the AWS resources required for hosting your static website. 
The variables.tf file allows customization, and the outputs.tf file provides essential information after deployment.

Now, let's embark on a journey to simplify your static website deployment. Explore the project, follow the steps, and witness the ease of hosting your content on Amazon S3 with Terraform.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
